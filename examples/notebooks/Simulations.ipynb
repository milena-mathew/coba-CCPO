[This search](https://www.openml.org/search?q=covertype&type=data) finds several data sets and we simply pick [the first one](https://www.openml.org/d/180). On the dataset's landing page we can look at the URL -- https://www.openml.org/d/180 -- to get the dataset's id of 180. Now, all we have to do to run an experiment with the Covertype data set is:\n"

    "The final, and most involved method, for creating new simulations in Coba is to create your own from scratch. This might be needed if you need to ingest a format that Coba doesn't already support. Or maybe you need your simulation to track some internal state between interactions. By creating your own Simulation there really is no limit to the functionality employed. In order to make your own simulation you'll first need to know a few simple classes/interfaces. We'll start with the Simulation interface.\n",

    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So long as your class satisfies this interface it should be completely interoperable with Coba. However, assuming you have access to coba classes there really isn't any reason to implement this interface yourself. In practice it should always suffice to use MemorySimulation (more on this soon).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interaction Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen above the Simulation interface relies on the Interaction interface:\n",

    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, while one can satisfy this interface from scratch we recommend developers simply use Coba's Interaction class. The types hints of Key, Context and Action actually have no constraints on them. We simply provide them for semantic interpretation and you are free to actually return anything you'd like as a key, context or collection of actions.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the box Coba provides a ClassificationReward which returns values of 1 or 0 depending on if Action is the true label associated with the observation uniquely identified by Key. For example, if a simulation is loaded from Csv then Key will be the row number of the given observation we are trying to label in the Csv file. Coba also provides MemoryReward which can be useful if Key is hashable and Action are hashable and it is possible to compute all rewards up front.\n",

    "When performing experiments Coba's benchmark actually expects to be given a Source that produces a Simulation rather than an actual Simulation. All standard simulations such as OpenmlSimulation, CsvSimulation, and LambdaSimulation are actually Sources.\n",
