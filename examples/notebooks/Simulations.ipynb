Openml.org is is an online repository of machine learning data sets which currently hosts over 21,000 datasets. Using dataset ids Coba can tap into this repository and download these datasets to create Simulations.\n",

    "To get a sense of how this works let's say we want to build a simulation from the Covertype data set. We can [do a dataset search](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data) on Openml.org to see if this data set is hosted. [This search](https://www.openml.org/search?q=covertype&type=data) finds several data sets and we simply pick [the first one](https://www.openml.org/d/180). On the dataset's landing page we can look at the URL -- https://www.openml.org/d/180 -- to get the dataset's id of 180. Now, all we have to do to run an experiment with the Covertype data set is:\n"

    "The final, and most involved method, for creating new simulations in Coba is to create your own from scratch. This might be needed if you need to ingest a format that Coba doesn't already support. Or maybe you need your simulation to track some internal state between interactions. By creating your own Simulation there really is no limit to the functionality employed. In order to make your own simulation you'll first need to know a few simple classes/interfaces. We'll start with the Simulation interface.\n",

    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So long as your class satisfies this interface it should be completely interoperable with Coba. We also recommend lazy loading when implementing your own simulation. That is interactions in general should not be created in memory until read is called.  This speeds up processing when multiprocessing and saves on memory .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interaction Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "The Simulation interface above also relies on the Interaction interface:\n",

    "Once again, while one can satisfy this interface from scratch we recommend developers simply use Coba's Interaction class. The types hints of Context, Action and Feedback actually have no constraints on them. We simply provide the hints for semantic interpretation and you are free to return anything you'd like in practice. These values are simply passed along to the Learners.\n"
